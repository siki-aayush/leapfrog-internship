                In this article, I’ll provide answers to the following questions related to prototyping:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What is a prototype and when do you need it?
                </li>
                <li>

                    What is “prototype fidelity” and what is the difference between a low-fidelity prototype and a
                    high-fidelity
                    prototype?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What techniques can be used to build prototypes?
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                <h2 class="blog__content__pHeader">What a prototype is, and what it isn’t</h2>
                <p>In its basic form, a prototype is an expression of design intent. Prototyping allows designers to
                    present
                    their designs and see them in action. In the context of digital products, a prototype is a
                    simulation of
                    the final interaction between the user and the interface. Depending on what a product team needs a
                    prototype to do, it can simulate an entire app or just a single interaction.

                    The following are two cases that require a prototype:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ensure the design concept works as intended.</strong> In most cases, it’s relatively
                        easy to
                        test a concept with real users. Once an interactive version of a product idea is in the hands of
                        real users, a product team will be able to see how a target audience wants to use the product.
                        Based
                        on this feedback, it’s possible to adjust an initial concept.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Determine if people are able use a product.</strong>Prototyping is essential for finding
                        and
                        resolving usability issues before launch. Testing reveals areas that need improvement. That’s
                        why so
                        many product teams create prototypes, have users test them, and iterate the design until it’s
                        good
                        enough.

                <h2 class="blog__content__pHeader">What is fidelity?</h2>
                <p>Prototypes don’t necessarily look like final products — they can have different fidelity. The
                    fidelity of
                    a prototype refers to how it conveys the look-and-feel of the final product (basically, its level of
                    detail and realism). Fidelity can vary in the areas of:

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Visual design
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Content
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        Interactivity
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="blog__content__pHeader">Low-fidelity prototyping</h2>
                <p>Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping is a quick and easy way to translate high-level design concepts into
                    tangible and testable artifacts. The first and most important role of lo-fi prototypes is to check
                    and
                    test functionality rather than the visual appearance of the product. Here are the basic
                    characteristics
                    of low-fidelity prototyping:</p>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="blog__content__sHeader">Pros</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Inexpensive</strong> The clear advantage of low-fidelity prototyping is its
                            extremely
                            low cost.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Fast</strong>

                            It’s possible to create a lo-fi paper prototype in just five to ten minutes. This allows
                            product
                            teams to explore different ideas without too much effort.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Collaborative</strong>
                            This type of prototyping stimulates group work. Since lo-fi prototyping doesn’t require
                            special skills, more people can be involved in the design process. Even non-designers can
                            play
                            an active
                            part in the idea-formulation process.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Clarifying</strong>
                            Both team members and stakeholders will have a much clearer expectation about an upcoming
                            project.hgygh

                        </li>

                    <h3 class="blog__content__sHeader">Cons</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Uncertainty during testing</strong>

                            With a lo-fi prototype, it might be unclear to test participants what is
                            supposed to work and what isn’t. A low-fidelity prototype requires a lot of imagination from
                            the
                            user,
                            limiting the outcome of user testing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Limited interactivity</strong>

                            It’s impossible to convey complex animations or transitions using this type of
                            prototype.
